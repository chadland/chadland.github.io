title: Generating new Norwegian girl baby names with Deep Learning and RNNs
---

This post will go through the use of Deep Recurrent Neural Nets using TensorFlow on how to generate new Norwegian girl baby names. This might be useful for upcoming (scared-to-death) parents not deciding on a potential name :) Our main goal with this task is to train a model that perhaps can generate new "sensible" character combinations to successfully create new names or names that do not exist in the training data. This is just a high level hands-on example on how to use TensorFlow and the underlying components used in the net will not be explained in detail.
